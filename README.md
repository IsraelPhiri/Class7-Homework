To run the code, copy and paste the code or open the code in a compilor like pycharm.The scatter plot shows me the class as clearly continuos and hence I can go ahead and use Logistic Regression.

Advanced: I used knn classification, the n=3 seems to be the optimum number of neighbours to use since the classifier uses the voting system to predict the outcome. Simply put the voting system works best when 3 choices are used since there would never be a tie or a monopoly.
The code for basic is the dataset-mlprocessor.py and the advanced part is dataset-mlprocessor-knn.py
A wine_dataset_in_2D.png file for scatterplot is also included.
